# RS232-STM32-Driver-for-MAX3232
# STM32 HAL RS232 Driver

## Overview

This project provides an RS232 driver implementation using the STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). The driver facilitates communication between an STM32 microcontroller and other devices via the RS232 interface, utilizing the MAX3232 or other compatible modular ICs for level conversion. This driver assumes a regular USART setup with TX, RX pins specified from .ioc STM32 CUBE IDE.

## Features

- Supports RS232 communication via UART
- Compatible with MAX3232 and similar level shifters
- Configurable baud rate, parity, stop bits, and flow control
- Full-duplex communication
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Easy integration with STM32CubeMX generated code
- Lightweight and efficient design

## Prerequisites

- STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F4, STM32F1, STM32L4 series)
- STM32CubeMX (for code generation and configuration)
- STM32 HAL library
- MAX3232 or similar RS232 level shifter IC
- Keil MDK, IAR Embedded Workbench, or STM32CubeIDE (for development)

## Installation

1. **Generate Code with STM32CubeMX:**
   - Open STM32CubeMX and create a new project.
   - Select your STM32 microcontroller model.
   - Configure a UART peripheral for RS232 communication.
   - Generate the initialization code.

2. **Integrate the RS232 Driver:**
   - Copy the generated UART-related files into your project directory.
   - Ensure the HAL library is included in your project.

3. **Add the RS232 Driver Source Files:**
   - Copy the provided RS232 driver source files (`rs232_driver.c`, `rs232_driver.h`) into your projectâ€™s source directory.
   - Include `rs232_driver.h` in your main application file.
